# Parallax header in Ionic 3
This application is a demo to show the implementation of a [parallax](http://materializecss.com/parallax.html) header.
Is usable in web and mobile environments, and could be used in Angular applications without any modification.
Is optimized to be used in mobile applications, but can be changed easily.

## How it works
All the implementation is done in a [@Directive](https://angular.io/guide/attribute-directives), that can be used anywhere inside the application.

## How to use it
The demo can be executed like any other Ionic application, using the Ionic CLI command: `ionic serve` to execute it in development mode.
The effect can be shown better in device-like views.

## References
This demo example was done following the tutorial made by Joshua Morony ([@joshuamorony](https://github.com/joshuamorony)) in 
[How to Create a Directive in Ionic 2 & 3 - Parallax Header](https://www.joshmorony.com/how-to-create-a-directive-in-ionic-2-parallax-header/), all credits to him.

## In the future
I intend to improve this example and the directive code in the future to make it more customizable, adaptable and try to follow more principles of good design.
